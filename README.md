# ResNet50 with C code
which create ResNet50 object classification model with C language without library.

all function is work and can get 50% accurancy in one iterate but the calculate speed is slower than python's library which because this program didn't include CUDA.

you can change the input for other dataset testing.

this project is using CIFAR-10 as the data-set
